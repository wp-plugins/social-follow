This plugin provides an easy way to implement your Social Follow button into the sidebar of your website.


== Description ==

Social Follow is to be used with a button you get at SocialFollow.com. This is not a replacement for signing up
on the website, it is a way to make it easy for anyone to put their Social Follow button in their sidebar 
without having to go into the coding of the website itself.

To work fully, it only requires the button code that you receive when you create a new button on 
SocialFollow.com.

1. Unzip and upload contents folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Social Follow in Wordpress Admin navigation
4. Put in your button code (as received from SocialFollow.com) and click "Update Social Follow Settings"
5. Go to Apperance -> Widgets in Wordpress Admin navigation
6. Add Social Follow to your sidebar

= Is Social Follow free? =
Yes! It is 100% free.

= Do I have to have a Social Follow account? =
Yes, you can sign up at http://www.socialfollow.com/register.php

= Where do I find my button code? =
There are two ways to get your button code, both are from SocialFollow.com.
	1. After you create your button, the success page will give you your button code.
	2. If you go to the "Manage", there is an icon under "Actions" for each button that will provide you
	   with that button's code.

Unfortunately, two buttons on one page will make the first button work incorrectly. We are actively working 
to fix this problem, so check back soon!
